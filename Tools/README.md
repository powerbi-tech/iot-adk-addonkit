# Powershell version of IoT-ADK-Addonkit

Powershell version of the iot-adk-addonkit extends the functionality with further validation / verification steps in the imaging process.

## What's new in 6.0

* Support of Workspace concept : Workspace is a directory with IoTWorkspace.xml file specifying its attributes. This directory structure is similar to earlier iot-adk-addonkit without the tools and templates directory. You can now have multiple workspaces for building different products and use one common tooling directory.
* Sample Workspace : The addon kit comes with a sample workspace that you can access via the env variable SAMPLEWKS (`$env:SAMPLEWKS`). You can import oem packages, bsp and products from this workspace into your workspace for your use.
* Upgrade existing iot-adk-addonkit directory : You can upgrade your existing iot-adk-addonkit directory into a workspace, see [Work with Existing Workspace](#work-with-existing-workspace)
* Powershell functions and equivalent cmd functions available for many new features. See [Supported Functionality listing](#supported-functionality-listing).

## Get started

The pre-requisite for using this tools are same as the earlier iot-adk-addonkit projects.

Install the following pre-requisites

* [Windows 10 IoT Core Packages](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10iotcore)
* [Windows Assessment and Deployment Kit](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/hardware/windows-assessment-deployment-kit) including Windows PE add-on for the adk
* Get your BSP for your platform. See [Windows 10 IoT Core BSPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/iot/bsphardware) for links to get the BSPs.
* Certificates - You will need to have these certificates (with private keys) in the local cert store ( either directly installed or loaded from a smart card)
  * Code signing certificate from a CA : Required for signing your drivers for building retail image
  * Code signing EV certificate from a CA : Required to register with Device Update Center and sign payload for submission
  * Security certificates from self : Required for the security features.

## Create a basic image

1. Launch the IoTCorePShell ( Run `IoTCorePShell.cmd` ). This will launch the tool and also install the test certificates if required and opens the sample workspace present along with the tools by default.

2. Create a new workspace (say `C:\MyWorkspace` ) using [New-IoTWorkspace](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/New-IoTWorkspace.md)

    ```powershell
    New-IoTWorkspace C:\MyWorkspace Contoso arm
    (or) new-ws C:\MyWorkspace Contoso arm
    ```

    The Workspace will be created and opened. It will also import few default packages required in the workspace.

3. Import the required oem packages using [Import-IoTOEMPackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Import-IoTOEMPackage.md) from the sample workspace (`$env:SAMPLEWKS`). You can either import each package selectively or import all of them.

    ```powershell
    # Importing Recovery packages from sample workspace
    Import-IoTOEMPackage Recovery.*
    (or) importpkg Recovery.*
    # Below example imports all packages from the sample workspace
    Import-IoTOEMPackage *
    (or) importpkg *
    ```

4. Import the required BSP (for example RPi2) using [Import-IoTBSP](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Import-IoTBSP.md)

    ```powershell
    # Importing RPi2 bsp from a folder
    Import-IoTBSP RPi2 C:\Myfolder\RPi_BSP
    (or) importbsp RPi2 C:\Myfolder\RPi_BSP
    (or) importbsp RPi2 C:\Downloads\RPi_BSP.zip

    # Importing an Intel bsp
    Import-IoTBSP APLx64 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel IoT\Source-x64\BSP"
    (or) importbsp APLx64 "C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel IoT\Source-x64\BSP"

    # Importing NXP BSPs found inside the zip or folder
    Import-IoTBSP *  C:\BSP\NXPBSP.zip
    (or) importbsp *  C:\BSP\NXPBSP_FOLDER
    (or) importbsp Sabre_iMX6Q_1GB  C:\BSP\NXPBSP.zip

    # Importing QCDB410C BSP packages found inside the zip
    ## special case - this invokes Import-QCBSP internally
    Import-IoTBSP QCDB410C C:\BSP\db410c_bsp.zip
    (or) importbsp QCDB410C C:\BSP\db410c_bsp.zip
    # the above will import the bsp from sample wkspace and copy the prebuilt cabs to Workspace\Prebuilt directory
    ```

    * For Qualcomm BSP, after downloading the zip file, you can extract the prebuilt cabs using

        ```powershell
        # Import the QCDB410 BSP and extract the required cabs from the QC zip file
        Import-QCBSP C:\BSP\db410c_bsp.zip C:\MyWorkspace\Prebuilt -ImportBSP
        ```

        `C:\MyWorkspace\Prebuilt` will be set as BSPPkgDir in the Workspace xml.

5. Create a new product (MyProduct) based on the imported BSP, say RPi2 in the below example, using [Add-IoTProduct](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTProduct.md)

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProduct MyProduct RPi2
    (or) newproduct MyProduct RPi2
    ```

    This will prompt you for the SMBIOS values to be used in the product.
    `DeviceInventory_MyProduct.xml` is also generated which is used to register your device on the DUC portal.

6. Build all packages using [New-IoTCabPackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/New-IoTCabPackage.md)

    ```powershell
    New-IoTCabPackage All
    (or) buildpkg all
    ```

7. Build the FFU image for MyProduct product, test configuration using [New-IoTFFUImage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/New-IoTFFUImage.md)

    ```powershell
    New-IoTFFUImage MyProduct Test
    (or) buildimage MyProduct Test
    ```

    This will also build the necessary product specific packages and the fm files before starting the image creation.

8. Build the recovery FFU image using [New-IoTRecoveryImage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/New-IoTRecoveryImage.md)

    ```powershell
    New-IoTRecoveryImage MyProduct Test
    (or) buildrecovery MyProduct Test
    ```

    Note that the device layout should have MMOS partition to be able to create recovery image. See [Recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/service/iot/recovery) for more details.

## Add your packages to your image

You can add an appx, driver, provisioning package, files and registry settings to your image by creating specific packages for each.

1. Add a **appx package** using [Add-IoTAppxPackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTAppxPackage.md)

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTAppxPackage C:\MyTest.appx fga
    (or) newappxpkg C:\MyTest.appx fga
    ```

    This also adds a feature id `APPX_MYTEST` in the OEMFM.xml file. You can add this feature to MyProduct using [Add-IoTProductFeature](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTProductFeature.md)

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All APPX_TEST -OEM
    (or) addfid MyProduct All APPX_TEST -OEM
    ```

    This will edit both retail and test oeminputxml files under MyProduct to add APPX_TEST feature under OEM node. You also need to make sure that you remove any other application feature id in the oeminputxml file such as IOT_BERTHA.

2. Add a **driver package** using [Add-IoTDriverPackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTDriverPackage.md)

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTDriverPackage C:\TestDriver\MyTest.inf
    (or) newdrvpkg C:\TestDriver\MyTest.inf
    ```

    This will copy all the files in the C:\TestDriver directory and also add a feature id `DRIVERS_MYTEST` in the OEMFM.xml file.
    You can add this feature to MyProduct using

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All DRIVERS_MYTEST -OEM
    (or) addfid MyProduct All DRIVERS_MYTEST -OEM
    ```

3. Add a **provisioning package** using [Add-IoTProvisioningPackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTProvisioningPackage.md)

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProvisioningPackage Prov.MySettings
    (or) newprovpkg Prov.MySettings
    ```

    You can then edit the provisioning customizations.xml file using WCD (icd.exe). Launch ICD.exe and open Prov.MySettings.icdproj.xml file that is generated to add the policies required.
    If you have created a ppkg file using ICD.exe already, you can import the same using
    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProvisioningPackage Prov.MySettings "C:\Users\username\Documents\Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (WICD)\MySettings\MySettings.ppkg"
    (or) newprovpkg Prov.MySettings2 "C:\Users\username\Documents\Windows Imaging and Configuration Designer (WICD)\MySettings\MySettings.ppkg"
    ```
    This will add a feature id `PROV_MYSETTINGS` in the OEMCOMMONFM.xml.
    You can add this feature to MyProduct using
    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All PROV_MYSETTINGS -OEM
    (or) addfid  MyProduct All PROV_MYSETTINGS -OEM
    ```
4. Add a **file package** using [Add-IoTFilePackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTFilePackage.md)

    ```powershell
    $myfiles = @(
        ("`$(runtime.system32)","C:\Temp\TestFile1.txt", ""),
        ("`$(runtime.bootDrive)\OEMInstall","C:\Temp\TestFile2.txt", "TestFile2.txt")
        )
    Add-IoTFilePackage Files.Configs $myfiles
    ```

    This will add a feature id `FILES_CONFIGS` in the OEMCOMMONFM.xml.
    You can add this feature to MyProduct using

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All FILES_CONFIGS -OEM
    (or) addfid MyProduct All FILES_CONFIGS -OEM
    ```

5. Add a **registry package** using [Add-IoTRegistryPackage](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTRegistryPackage.md)

    ```powershell
    $myregkeys = @(
        ("`$(hklm.software)\`$(OEMNAME)\Test","StringValue", "REG_SZ", "Test string"),
        ("`$(hklm.software)\`$(OEMNAME)\Test","DWordValue", "REG_DWORD", "0x12AB34CD"))
    Add-IoTRegistryPackage Reg.Settings $myregkeys
    ```

    This will add a feature id `REG_SETTINGS` in the OEMCOMMONFM.xml.
    You can add this feature to MyProduct using

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All REG_SETTINGS -OEM
    (or) addfid MyProduct All REG_SETTINGS -OEM
    ```

6. You can build the above packages using `buildpkg` command discussed earlier and create an FFU using `buildimage` command.

### Adding Security packages

In order to enable security features such as Secure boot, Bitlocker and Device guard, you will require specific certificates to be created and accessible from the machine where the image is built. See [Turnkey Security on IoT Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/iot-core/secure-your-device/securebootandbitlocker#turnkey-security-on-iot-core) for the details on these security features and [Windows Secure Boot Key Creation and Management Guidance](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-secure-boot-key-creation-and-management-guidance) for managing certificates.

For testing purposes, following commands are provided to create and install the certs in your machine.

1. Create OEM Certs using [New-IoTOEMCerts](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/New-IoTOEMCerts.md)

    ```powershell
    New-IoTOEMCerts
    ```

    This will prompt you to enter password for the certs that are created. The created certificates are in the workspace certs folder and the pfx files with the private keys are in the certs\private folder.

2. Install the pfx files required for the signing process during the security package creation, using [Install-IoTOEMCerts](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Install-IoTOEMCerts.md)

     ```powershell
    Install-IoTOEMCerts
    ```

3. If you already have the certs to use for security packages, you can import them using [Import-IoTCertificate](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Import-IoTCertificate.md)

    ```powershell
    # PlatformKey and KeyExchangeKey mandatory for SecureBoot
    Import-IoTCertificate $env:SAMPLEWKS\Certs\OEM-PK.cer PlatformKey
    Import-IoTCertificate $env:SAMPLEWKS\Certs\OEM-UEFISB.cer KeyExchangeKey
    # DataRecoveryAgent mandatory for Bitlocker
    Import-IoTCertificate $env:SAMPLEWKS\Certs\OEM-DRA.cer DataRecoveryAgent
    # Update mandatory for Device Guard
    Import-IoTCertificate $env:SAMPLEWKS\Certs\OEM-PAUTH.cer Update
    Import-IoTCertificate $env:SAMPLEWKS\Certs\OEM-UMCI.cer User
    ```

4. You can now create the security packages using [Add-IoTSecureBoot](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTSecureBoot.md),[Add-IoTDeviceGuard](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTDeviceGuard.md) and [Add-IoTBitLocker](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTBitLocker.md)

    ```powershell
     # Create Secure boot package
    Add-IoTSecureBoot -Test
    # Create Device guard package
    Add-IoTDeviceGuard -Test
    # Create Bitlocker package
    Add-IoTBitLocker
    ```

    (or) you can create them all using [Add-IoTSecurityPackages](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Add-IoTSecurityPackages.md)

    ```powershell
    Add-IoTSecurityPackages
    ```

5. Now that the new security packages are created, include the Security features `SEC_BITLOCKER`,`SEC_SECUREBOOT_TEST` and `SEC_DEVICEGUARD_TEST` in the oeminputxml file.
    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All SEC_BITLOCKER -OEM
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All SEC_SECUREBOOT_TEST -OEM
    Add-IoTProductFeature MyProduct All SEC_DEVICEGUARD_TEST -OEM
    ```

6. You can build the above packages using `buildpkg` command discussed earlier and create an FFU using `buildimage` command.

## Building a Retail FFU

To build an retail image, you will need to retail sign all your packages and then create the FFU image.

1. Configure the code signing certificate for retail signing in the Workspace xml
    ```xml
    <!--Specify the retail signing certificate details, Format given below -->
    <RetailSignToolParam>/s my /i "Issuer" /n "Subject" /ac "C:\CrossCertRoot.cer" /fd SHA256</RetailSignToolParam>
    ```
    You could also specify the certificate by the thumbprint
    ```xml
    <!--Specify the retail signing certificate details, Format given below -->
    <RetailSignToolParam>/s my /sha1 "thumbprint" /fd SHA256</RetailSignToolParam>
    ```

2. Enable retail signing with [Set-IoTRetailSign](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Set-IoTRetailSign.md)

    ```powershell
    Set-IoTRetailSign On
    (or) retailsign On
    ```

    This will set the sign tool parameter to the certificate specified as `RetailSignToolParam` in the Workspace xml. You will also see the prompt highlighting that the Retail mode is on.

3. Rebuild all your packages with

    ```powershell
    New-IoTCabPackage All
    (or) buildpkg all
    ```

    Note : If you are using security packages, ensure to generate the retail version of the packages (without -Test flag) and include the corresponding feature id in the RetailOEMInput.xml file.

4. If you have prebuilt bsp cab packages, re-sign them using [Redo-IoTCabSignature](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Redo-IoTCabSignature.md)

    ```powershell
    Redo-IoTCabSignature <srccabdir> <dstcabdir>
    (or) re-signcabs <srccabdir> <dstcabdir>
    ```

    Set the BSPPkgDir setting to the `dstcabdir` in the product settings xml for retail configuration.

5. Build the image for retail configuration.

    ```powershell
    New-IoTFFUImage RPiRecovery Retail
    (or) buildimage RPiRecovery Retail
    ```

    This will also build the necessary product specific packages and the fm files before starting the image creation.

6. Build the Retail recovery FFU image with
    ```powershell
    New-IoTRecoveryImage RPiRecovery Retail
    (or) buildrecovery RPiRecovery Retail
    ```

## Work with Existing Workspace

Steps to upgrade your existing iot-adk-addonkit project directory.

1. Launch the IoTCorePShell ( Run `IoTCorePShell.cmd` ). This will launch the tool and also install the test certificates if required and opens the sample workspace present along with the tools by default.

2. Run the migration command for the existing repo dir say `C:\Myproject\iot-adk-addonkit`, using [Redo-IoTWorkspace](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Redo-IoTWorkspace.md)

    ```powershell
    Redo-IoTWorkspace C:\Myproject\iot-adk-addonkit
    (or) migrate C:\Myproject\iot-adk-addonkit
    ```

    This command will generate the workspace xml file and product specific settings file that is required for rest of the scripts to work. The SMBIOS data for the product will be set to default and you will be required to update them to the proper values. For Qualcomm based products, the SMBIOS values from the SMBIOS.cfg will be used.

3. The tools and templates directory under your repo is not required anymore. These can be deleted ( note that the above command does not delete these folders, but moves them to a ToDelete folder).

4. Open this workspace using [Open-IoTWorkspace](IoTCoreImaging/Docs/Open-IoTWorkspace.md) and start using this as a new workspace described above.

    ```powershell
    Open-IoTWorkspace C:\Myproject\iot-adk-addonkit\IoTWorkspace.xml
    (or) open-ws C:\Myproject\iot-adk-addonkit\IoTWorkspace.xml
    ```

## Work with Device Update Center

Steps to register your device on the device update center and publish updates are given below.

1. Register with the Device Update Center portal. You will require an EV cert for this process.
2. Configure the EV cert used in the Device Update Center in the Workspace.
    ```xml
        <!--Specify the ev signing certificate details, Format given below -->
        <EVSignToolParam>/s my /i "Issuer" /n "Subject" /fd SHA256</EVSignToolParam>
    ```
3. Create a product
    ```powershell
    Add-IoTProduct SampleA RPi2
    (or) newproduct SampleA RPi2
    ```
    You will find an device inventory file `IoTDeviceModel_<product>.xml`. Use this file to register your device model in the DUC portal. If you change the SMBIOS fields or install a different IoTCore Kit version, you can regenerate this file using
    ```powershell
    Export-IoTDeviceModel SampleA
    (or) exportidm SampleA
    ```
4. Once the device model is registered in the portal, you can download `CUSConfig.zip` file from the portal. You can then import this file into the product configuration using
    ```powershell
    Import-IoTDUCConfig SampleA "C:\Users\MyUser\Downloads\CUSConfig.zip"
    (or) importcfg SampleA "C:\Users\MyUser\Downloads\CUSConfig.zip"
    ```
    This will create a CUSConfig folder in the Product\Packages directory and also update the oeminput xml files.
5. Rebuild the image with the CUSConfig included. This will be the base shipping image for your device model.
    ```powershell
    New-IoTFFUImage SampleA Retail
    (or) buildimage SampleA Retail
    ```
6. When you have new update to create, **modify/update the OEM package contents** and increment the BSP_VERSION
    ```powershell
    Set-IoTCabVersion 10.0.1.0
    (or) setversion 10.0.1.0
    ```
7. Rebuild your packages and build your ffu image with the updated packages. Validate this FFU for functionality. You can then export the update package using
    ```powershell
    Export-IoTDUCCab SampleA Retail
    (or) exportpkgs SampleA Retail
    ```
    This will create a cab file under `$env:BUILD_DIR\<product>\<Config>\$env:BSP_VERSION`
8. You can upload this cab in the DUC portal.
